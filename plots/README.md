# Plots Directory

This directory contains visualization results from experiments.

Generated by running:
```bash
python visualize_results.py
```

## Expected Files

After running visualization, you should see:

- `accuracy_comparison_iid.png` - Test accuracy comparison on IID data
- `accuracy_comparison_noniid.png` - Test accuracy comparison on Non-IID data  
- `dimension_history.png` - Projection dimension trajectory over training
- `comm_accuracy_tradeoff.png` - Communication cost vs accuracy tradeoff

## Notes

- Plots are generated from `resnet18_cifar100_dynamic.log`
- Make sure to run experiments first: `python resnet18_dynamic.py`
- High-resolution (300 dpi) PNG format for publication quality
