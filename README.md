This repository contains the implementation of **FedRP**, a novel federated learning algorithm that enhances communication efficiency and privacy by combining **Random Projection** with the **ADMM optimization framework**. FedRP is designed for federated learning settings and provides a strong (ϵ, δ)-Differential Privacy guarantee without sacrificing model accuracy.

## 🧠 Method Overview

FedRP introduces a secure dimension-reduction step (via random projection) on the client side before model updates are sent to the server. This significantly reduces communication costs and enhances privacy by preventing reconstruction attacks.

  * Clients use a **shared random projection matrix** to project model parameters.
  * Optimization is performed using **Consensus ADMM** in the projected space.
  * FedRP avoids the need to reverse the projections, unlike FedSketch and similar methods.

## ✨ Key Features

  * **Communication Efficiency**: Reduces the amount of data transmitted between clients and the server by using random projections.
  * **Differential Privacy**: Provides formal privacy guarantees through the combination of random projections and ADMM.
  * **Implemented Algorithms**: Includes implementations of FedAvg, FedAvgDP, FedADMM, and FedRP for comparison.
  * **Model and Dataset**: Uses a ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

## 🆕 NEW: Dynamic Random Projection (2025)

We have extended FedRP with **dynamic projection dimension adjustment** mechanisms:

  * **FedRP_Linear**: Linearly increases projection dimension over training rounds
    - 📉 Reduces communication cost by ~72% compared to FedAvg
    - 🎯 Maintains accuracy within 3% of baseline
  
  * **FedRP_Adaptive**: Intelligently adjusts dimension based on model convergence
    - 🧠 Adapts to training dynamics automatically
    - ⚖️ Achieves optimal balance between communication and accuracy
  
  * **Non-IID Support**: Validated on heterogeneous data distributions
    - 📊 Dirichlet-based data partitioning
    - 💪 Robust performance across IID and Non-IID scenarios

**Quick Start with Dynamic FedRP**:
```bash
# Quick test (5 minutes)
python quick_test.py

# Full experiments (2-4 hours)
python resnet18_dynamic.py

# Visualize results
python visualize_results.py
```

## 🔧 Requirements

The code is written in Python 3 and requires the following libraries:

  * `torch`
  * `torchvision`
  * `numpy`
  * `tqdm` (for progress bars)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy tqdm
```

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the experiments, simply execute the `resnet18.py` script:

```bash
python resnet18.py
```

The script will run the experiments for FedAvg, FedAvgDP, FedADMM, and FedRP sequentially. The results will be printed to the console and saved in `resnet18_cifar100_main.log`.
